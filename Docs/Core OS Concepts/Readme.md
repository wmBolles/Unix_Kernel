# Core OS Concepts

Welcome to the "Core OS Concepts" section of our repository. In this section, we will explore some of the foundational concepts that underpin modern operating systems. Here, you will find detailed explanations and insights into key topics, including File Descriptors, Memory Management, CPU Registers, MMU (Memory Management Unit), and System Calls.

## File Descriptors (FD)

File Descriptors are essential elements in the world of system programming. They represent open files, sockets, and other I/O resources. Understanding file descriptors is crucial for managing input and output in your applications. Our documentation here covers:

- What are File Descriptors?
- File Descriptor Types
- File Operations with FDs
- Best Practices in FD Handling

## Memory Management

Memory Management is a fundamental aspect of operating systems, responsible for allocating and managing memory resources. Our documentation on memory management includes:

- Overview of Memory Management
- Types of Memory (Physical, Virtual)
- Paging and Segmentation
- Memory Protection
- Memory Allocation Strategies

## CPU Registers and MMU

CPU Registers play a critical role in low-level programming and system operation. Learn about:

- CPU Registers and Their Functions
- How the Memory Management Unit (MMU) works
- Address Translation and Virtual Memory

## System Calls

System Calls act as the interface between user-level applications and the kernel. Our coverage of system calls includes:

- What are System Calls?
- Common System Calls in Unix-like Systems
- How to Use System Calls in C Programs
